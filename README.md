Fake URL Detector

Welcome to the Fake URL Detector GitHub repository. In this project, I, [Your Name], had the privilege of leading a talented team of developers who worked collaboratively to create a powerful tool for identifying fake or malicious URLs. While I provided guidance, contributed some code, and took on the role of project leader, the bulk of the development work was carried out by my dedicated teammates.
Team Members

I'd like to acknowledge and give credit to the amazing individuals who made this project possible:

    Teammate 1 (Very0n88 from Vietnam): Very0n88 made significant contributions to the project by implementing the core URL analysis algorithms and handling data preprocessing. Their expertise in data manipulation and algorithm development was crucial in the success of the Fake URL Detector.

    Teammate 2 (Mukesh Mittal, a close friend from school): Mukesh Mittal played a crucial role in the project, focusing on the user interface and overall user experience. They were responsible for designing and implementing the front-end of the tool, ensuring that the tool was user-friendly and easy to navigate.

    Teammate 3 (Discord Programmers): The Discord programmers significantly contributed to the project by creating an integration with Discord, allowing users to analyze URLs directly within their Discord server. This integration extended the tool's reach and usefulness, making it accessible to a broader audience.

    Teammate 4 (Friend from School): Your friend from school was instrumental in optimizing the codebase and ensuring its efficiency. They focused on performance enhancements and code refactoring, making the Fake URL Detector a robust and responsive tool.

Project Overview

Our Fake URL Detector is designed to help users identify potentially harmful URLs by analyzing various characteristics and patterns commonly found in phishing and malicious websites. The tool provides a straightforward API and user-friendly interface for URL analysis.
